# How to Implement a Work Package

Use this guide to implement a single work package (WP) in its own workspace.

## Prerequisites

- Tasks have been generated and finalized
- You know the WP ID (for example, `WP01`)

## Step 1: Get the WP Prompt

Use the slash command in your agent (recommended):

```text
/spec-kitty.implement
```

Or run the workflow command directly:

```bash
spec-kitty agent workflow implement WP01 --agent <agent>
```

This moves the WP to `lane: "doing"` and prints the full prompt plus the completion command.

## Step 2: Create the Workspace

In your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty implement WP01
```

If the WP depends on another WP, branch from the base work package:

```bash
spec-kitty implement WP02 --base WP01
```

## Step 3: Work in the Worktree

In your terminal:

```bash
cd .worktrees/###-feature-WP01
```

Implement the prompt, run required tests, and commit your changes in the WP worktree.

## Step 4: Mark the WP Ready for Review

Use the exact command printed in the prompt. In your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to for_review --note "Ready for review: <summary>"
```

## What Happens

- A dedicated workspace is created for the WP (`.worktrees/###-feature-WP01/`)
- The WP lane is updated to `doing`
- Dependencies are enforced via `--base`

> **Note**: Spec Kitty creates git worktrees for each work package. Each worktree has its own isolated workspace and branch.

## Troubleshooting

- **"Base workspace does not exist"**: Implement the dependency first.
- **"WP has dependencies"**: Re-run with `--base WPXX`.
- **No prompt shown**: Run `/spec-kitty.implement` or `spec-kitty agent workflow implement` again.
