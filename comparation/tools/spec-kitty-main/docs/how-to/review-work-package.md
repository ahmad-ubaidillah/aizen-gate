# How to Review a Work Package

Use this guide to review a completed work package and update its lane.

## Prerequisites

- The WP is in `lane: "for_review"`
- You are in the WP worktree (or the feature worktree containing the implementation)

## The Command

In your agent:

```text
/spec-kitty.review
```

You can also specify a WP ID:

```text
/spec-kitty.review WP01
```

## Review Process

The review command:
- Picks the next WP in `for_review` (or the one you specify)
- Moves it to `lane: "doing"` for review
- Shows the full prompt and the exact commands for passing or requesting changes

## Providing Feedback

If changes are required:
1. Add feedback in the **Review Feedback** section of the WP file.
2. Move the WP back to `planned` so the implementer can pick it up again.

In your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to planned --note "Changes requested: <summary>"
```

## Passing Review

When everything looks good, move the WP to `done`.

In your terminal:

```bash
spec-kitty agent tasks move-task WP01 --to done --note "Approved"
```

## Troubleshooting

- **No WPs found**: Confirm at least one WP is in `for_review`.
- **Wrong workspace**: Open the WP worktree that contains the implementation.
- **Need more context**: Check the spec and plan for the feature before completing review.
