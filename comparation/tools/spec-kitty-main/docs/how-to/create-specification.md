# How to Create a Feature Specification

Use this guide to capture a new feature specification with `/spec-kitty.specify`.

## When to Use

Run this when you are starting a brand-new feature and need a spec before planning or implementation.

## The Command

In your agent:

```text
/spec-kitty.specify <description>
```

Run it from the main repository root. In v0.11.0+, planning artifacts live in `kitty-specs/` on `main`, and no worktrees are created during specify.

## The Discovery Interview

After the command, the CLI interviews you for missing details. You must answer each question before the spec is generated. Expect the agent to respond with `WAITING_FOR_DISCOVERY_INPUT` until the interview is complete.

## What Gets Created

- `kitty-specs/###-feature/spec.md`
- `kitty-specs/###-feature/meta.json`
- `kitty-specs/###-feature/checklists/requirements.md`

## Example

```text
/spec-kitty.specify Build a photo organizer that groups albums by date and supports drag-and-drop reordering.
```

During discovery, answer follow-up questions (roles, constraints, success criteria). Once complete, the spec is written to `kitty-specs/<feature>/spec.md` on `main`.

## Troubleshooting

- **Stuck on discovery**: Answer the remaining interview questions. The spec will not be created until the interview is complete.
- **Wrong directory**: Run from the main repository root, not from a worktree.
- **Need to revise the spec**: Re-run `/spec-kitty.specify` with the updated description and follow the interview again.
