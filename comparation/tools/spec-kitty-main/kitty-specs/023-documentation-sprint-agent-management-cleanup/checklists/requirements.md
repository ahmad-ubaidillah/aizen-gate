# Specification Quality Checklist: Documentation Sprint: Agent Management and Cleanup

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) ✅ Spec mentions source files for validation context only
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs ✅ All user stories explain value and priority
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders ✅ Plain language, minimal jargon
- [x] All mandatory sections completed ✅ User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria present

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain ✅ Zero markers found
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous ✅ All 19 FRs use MUST with observable outcomes
- [x] Success criteria are measurable ✅ All 6 SCs have specific metrics (90%, zero, 100%, etc.)
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) ✅ Validation methods mentioned but don't prescribe implementation
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined ✅ Given/When/Then for all 5 user stories
- [x] Edge cases are identified ✅ 5 edge cases documented
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded ✅ Out of Scope section defines 6 exclusions
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified ✅ 5 assumptions, 4 dependencies documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria ✅ User story acceptance scenarios map to FRs
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows ✅ 5 user stories prioritized P1-P3
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria ✅ All SCs are measurable and achievable
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification ✅ Spec describes WHAT to document, not HOW to implement

## Validation Summary

**Status**: ✅ PASSED - All checklist items complete

**Key Strengths**:
- Clear prioritization (P1: core workflows, P2: automation, P3: edge cases)
- Comprehensive coverage (19 functional requirements across 4 categories)
- Measurable success criteria with specific metrics
- Well-defined scope boundaries (6 out-of-scope items prevent scope creep)

**Ready for**: `/spec-kitty.clarify` or `/spec-kitty.plan`

## Notes

All validation items passed on first review. Specification is complete and ready for planning phase.
