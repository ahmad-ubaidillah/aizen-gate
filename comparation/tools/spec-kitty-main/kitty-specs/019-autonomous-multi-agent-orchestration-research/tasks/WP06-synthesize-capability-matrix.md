# Work Package Prompt: WP06 – Synthesize CLI Capability Matrix

## Objectives & Success Criteria

Consolidate all research findings from WP01-WP05 into a comprehensive capability matrix and orchestration assessment.

**Success Criteria**:
- CLI capability matrix complete for all 12 agents
- Orchestration-ready agents identified
- Partially-capable and non-capable agents categorized
- Quality gates verified (QG-001 through QG-004)
- `research.md` updated with consolidated findings

## Context & Constraints

**IMPORTANT**: This WP depends on WP01-WP05 completing first. Do not start until all research files exist.

**Prerequisites**:
- All 12 agent research files in `research/` directory
- Each file must follow the template from plan.md

Reference documents:
- `kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/spec.md` - Success criteria
- `kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/research.md` - Template to populate

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T024 – Review All Research Files for Completeness

**Purpose**: Verify all 12 research files exist and are complete.

**Steps**:
1. List all files in `research/`:
   ```bash
   ls -la research/
   ```
2. Verify all 12 files exist:
   - `01-claude-code.md`
   - `02-github-copilot.md`
   - `03-google-gemini.md`
   - `04-cursor.md`
   - `05-qwen-code.md`
   - `06-opencode.md`
   - `07-windsurf.md`
   - `08-github-codex.md`
   - `09-kilocode.md`
   - `10-augment-code.md`
   - `11-roo-cline.md`
   - `12-amazon-q.md`
3. Check each file has all required sections from template
4. Note any incomplete sections that need follow-up

---

### Subtask T025 – Build CLI Capability Matrix

**Purpose**: Create the central capability matrix.

**Steps**:
1. Open `research.md` and locate the matrix template
2. For each agent, extract from research file:
   - CLI Available: Yes/No/Partial
   - Invocation Command: exact command or "N/A"
   - Task Input: argument/stdin/file/prompt_file/env
   - Completion Detection: exit codes, output format
   - Parallel Support: Yes/No + constraints
3. Fill in all 12 rows
4. Ensure no TBD values remain

**Matrix columns**:
| Agent | CLI Available | Invocation Command | Task Input | Completion Detection | Parallel Support |

---

### Subtask T026 – Identify Orchestration-Ready Agents

**Purpose**: Determine which agents can fully participate in autonomous workflows.

**Criteria for "orchestration-ready"**:
- CLI exists and works headlessly
- Can accept task input (prompt file preferred)
- Has clear completion signal (exit code or output)
- Can run multiple instances (no strict singleton)

**Steps**:
1. Review matrix for agents meeting all criteria
2. List orchestration-ready agents
3. For each, note:
   - Recommended invocation pattern
   - Any setup requirements
   - Rate limit considerations

---

### Subtask T027 – Identify Partially-Capable Agents

**Purpose**: Categorize agents that need workarounds.

**"Partially capable" means**:
- Has API but no CLI (needs wrapper script)
- Has CLI but limited task input options
- Can run but needs IDE context
- Has rate limits that constrain parallelization

**Steps**:
1. Review matrix for partial cases
2. For each, document:
   - What capability is missing
   - Possible workaround
   - Integration complexity (Low/Medium/High)

---

### Subtask T028 – Identify Non-Capable Agents

**Purpose**: Document agents that cannot participate in orchestration.

**"Non-capable" means**:
- No CLI or API access
- Requires IDE to function
- No programmatic invocation possible

**Steps**:
1. Review matrix for non-capable agents
2. For each, document:
   - Why it cannot participate
   - Any future possibilities (planned features)
3. Be honest - don't force-fit unsuitable agents

---

### Subtask T029 – Update research.md

**Purpose**: Complete the consolidated research document.

**Steps**:
1. Update Executive Summary with key findings
2. Populate CLI Capability Matrix (from T025)
3. Write sections:
   - Agents Ready for Autonomous Orchestration (from T026)
   - Agents with Partial Support (from T027)
   - Agents Not Suitable (from T028)
4. Fill in Key Findings by Research Question (RQ-1 through RQ-6)
5. Add Source Index (master list of all URLs consulted)

---

### Subtask T030 – Verify Quality Gates

**Purpose**: Ensure research meets required quality standards.

**Quality Gates from spec.md**:
- **QG-001**: At least 6 of 12 agents have documented CLI invocation paths
- **QG-002**: Cursor CLI specifically documented (per user request)
- **QG-003**: All research findings include source links (documentation URLs)
- **QG-004**: Parallel execution constraints documented for CLI-capable agents

**Steps**:
1. Count CLI-capable agents → must be ≥6
2. Verify Cursor research is complete with clear verdict
3. Check each research file has Sources section
4. Verify parallel constraints documented for CLI agents
5. Update Quality Gate Assessment table in research.md

**If gate fails**: Document what's missing and whether additional research needed.

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Research files incomplete | Flag for follow-up, don't block synthesis |
| Fewer than 6 CLI agents | Document honestly, may affect orchestration viability |
| Conflicting information | Verify with local testing, note uncertainty |

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] All 12 research files reviewed for completeness
- [ ] CLI capability matrix populated (no TBD values)
- [ ] Orchestration-ready agents identified
- [ ] Partially-capable agents documented
- [ ] Non-capable agents documented
- [ ] `research.md` updated with consolidated findings
- [ ] Quality gates verified (QG-001 through QG-004)
- [ ] Source index complete

## Review Guidance

- Verify matrix data matches individual research files
- Check quality gate assessment is accurate
- Ensure honest assessment (don't overstate capabilities)
- Confirm Cursor is specifically addressed (user priority)
