# Work Package Prompt: WP04 – Research Cloud/API Agents

## Objectives & Success Criteria

Research the 2 agents that are primarily cloud/API-based:

1. **Google Gemini** (Google) - Gemini API, possibly `gemini` CLI or `gcloud ai`
2. **Qwen Code** (Alibaba) - DashScope API, possibly Alibaba Cloud CLI

**Success Criteria**:
- Both agents have completed research files
- CLI or API invocation method documented
- Authentication requirements documented
- Clear assessment of orchestration viability

## Context & Constraints

- **Challenge**: Both may require cloud SDK or direct API calls
- **Approach**: Check for official CLIs, cloud SDK commands, API wrappers
- **Scope**: Headless/CLI only - API calls count if scriptable

Reference documents:
- `kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/spec.md` - Research questions
- `kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/plan.md` - Research template

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T015 – Research Google Gemini [P]

**Purpose**: Document Gemini's CLI/API capabilities for automation.

**Steps**:
1. Check for Gemini CLI:
   ```bash
   which gemini
   gemini --help
   pip search google-generativeai
   npm search @google/generative-ai
   ```
2. Check Google Cloud CLI:
   ```bash
   gcloud ai --help
   gcloud ai models list
   ```
3. Research Gemini API:
   - Visit https://ai.google.dev/docs
   - Find API endpoint structure
   - Check for code-specific features
4. Check for Google AI Studio CLI tools
5. Document authentication (API key vs OAuth vs service account)
6. Test basic invocation if CLI exists

**Files**: Create `research/03-google-gemini.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes - independent of other agent

**Key Questions**:
- Is there a `gemini` CLI tool?
- Can `gcloud ai` invoke Gemini for code tasks?
- What's the API endpoint for code generation?
- Are there Python/Node SDKs for scripting?
- What about Gemini Code Assist specifically?

### Subtask T016 – Research Qwen Code [P]

**Purpose**: Document Qwen Code's CLI/API capabilities.

**Steps**:
1. Check for Qwen CLI:
   ```bash
   which qwen qwen-code
   pip search qwen dashscope
   ```
2. Check Alibaba Cloud CLI:
   ```bash
   aliyun --help
   aliyun ai --help
   ```
3. Research DashScope API (Alibaba's AI platform):
   - Visit https://dashscope.aliyun.com/
   - Find API documentation
   - Check for code-specific models
4. Search for third-party Qwen CLI wrappers
5. Document authentication (Alibaba Cloud credentials, API key)
6. Check if Qwen models available on other platforms (Hugging Face, etc.)

**Files**: Create `research/05-qwen-code.md`

**Parallel?**: Yes - independent of other agent

**Key Questions**:
- Is there a standalone Qwen CLI?
- Does Alibaba Cloud CLI have AI/Qwen commands?
- What's the DashScope API structure?
- Can Qwen-Coder models be accessed programmatically?
- Are there open-source Qwen CLI tools?

### Subtask T017 – Document Cloud Authentication Requirements

**Purpose**: Detail authentication setup for both cloud agents.

**Steps**:
1. For Google Gemini:
   - Document API key generation process
   - Note OAuth flow if needed
   - Service account setup for CI/CD
   - Environment variable names (GOOGLE_API_KEY, etc.)
2. For Qwen Code:
   - Document Alibaba Cloud account requirements
   - DashScope API key generation
   - Environment variable names
3. Compare authentication complexity
4. Note any regional restrictions

**Files**: Add authentication sections to both research files

---

### Subtask T018 – Write Research Files

**Purpose**: Complete both research files following template.

**Steps**:
1. Ensure all sections from plan.md template are filled
2. For API-only agents, document:
   - How to make API calls from scripts
   - Rate limits and quotas
   - Pricing tier information
3. Write orchestration assessment:
   - Can participate in autonomous workflow? Yes/No/Partial
   - If API-only: note that wrapper script may be needed
4. Add source links

**Files**:
- `research/03-google-gemini.md`
- `research/05-qwen-code.md`

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Requires cloud account setup | Document requirements clearly |
| API-only (no CLI) | Note wrapper script needed for orchestration |
| Regional restrictions | Document availability |
| Pricing concerns | Note free tier limits |

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] Google Gemini researched (CLI, gcloud, API)
- [ ] Qwen Code researched (CLI, Alibaba Cloud, DashScope)
- [ ] Authentication requirements documented
- [ ] Research files created: `research/03-google-gemini.md`, `research/05-qwen-code.md`
- [ ] Each file follows template from plan.md
- [ ] Source links included
- [ ] Orchestration assessment completed

## Review Guidance

- Verify cloud CLI options were tested
- Check that API documentation was reviewed
- Confirm authentication steps are actionable
- Accept API-only status if no CLI exists

## Activity Log

- 2026-01-18T14:41:27Z – system – lane=planned – Prompt created.
- 2026-01-18T15:26:17Z – claude-opus – shell_pid=22794 – lane=doing – Started implementation via workflow command
- 2026-01-18T15:31:30Z – claude-opus – shell_pid=22794 – lane=for_review – Ready for review: Completed research on Google Gemini CLI and Qwen Code CLI. Both have full headless mode support, JSON output, auto-approval modes, and are orchestration-ready. Authentication documented for OAuth, API key, and cloud provider options.
- 2026-01-18T15:32:10Z – claude-opus – shell_pid=26919 – lane=doing – Started review via workflow command
