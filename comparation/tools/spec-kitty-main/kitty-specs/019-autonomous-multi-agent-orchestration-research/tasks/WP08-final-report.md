# Work Package Prompt: WP08 – Final Report & Recommendations

## Objectives & Success Criteria

Write the executive summary, feasibility assessment, and architecture recommendations to complete the research project.

**Success Criteria**:
- Executive summary in `research.md`
- Feasibility assessment: can autonomous orchestration work?
- Minimum viable agent set identified
- Architecture recommendation for orchestrator
- Gaps and future research documented
- All documentation cross-referenced
- Research project complete and ready for stakeholder review

## Context & Constraints

**IMPORTANT**: This is the final WP. Depends on WP06 (synthesis) and WP07 (config design).

**Goal**: Provide actionable recommendations for implementing autonomous multi-agent orchestration.

Reference documents:
- `kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/spec.md` - Success criteria SC-001 through SC-007
- `kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/research.md` - Findings to summarize
- `kitty-specs/019-autonomous-multi-agent-orchestration-research/data-model.md` - Config schema

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T038 – Write Executive Summary

**Purpose**: Provide high-level overview for stakeholders.

**Steps**:
1. Open `research.md` and locate Executive Summary section
2. Write 2-3 paragraph summary covering:
   - Research objective recap
   - Key findings (how many agents have CLI?)
   - Overall feasibility verdict
   - Primary recommendation
3. Keep it accessible to non-technical readers
4. Highlight the most important discovery

**Example structure**:
```markdown
## Executive Summary

This research investigated the headless CLI capabilities of 12 AI coding
agents to determine feasibility of autonomous multi-agent orchestration
for spec-kitty.

**Key Finding**: [X] of 12 agents have CLI tools suitable for automation...

**Recommendation**: [Primary recommendation]...
```

### Subtask T039 – Write Feasibility Assessment

**Purpose**: Answer the core question: Can autonomous orchestration work?

**Assessment criteria**:
1. Sufficient CLI-capable agents exist (target: ≥6)
2. Task input mechanisms support prompt files
3. Completion detection is reliable
4. Parallel execution is feasible
5. Configuration complexity is manageable

**Steps**:
1. Score each criterion based on findings
2. Provide overall feasibility verdict:
   - **Fully Feasible**: Most agents work, clear path forward
   - **Partially Feasible**: Some agents work, workarounds needed
   - **Not Feasible**: Too few agents, too many limitations
3. Document key enablers and blockers
4. Be honest about limitations discovered

---

### Subtask T040 – Identify Minimum Viable Agent Set

**Purpose**: Define the smallest set of agents for initial orchestration.

**Steps**:
1. From orchestration-ready agents, identify:
   - Best implementation agent (most capable, best documented)
   - Best review agent (ideally different from implementation)
   - Backup agent (fallback option)
2. Document why these were chosen
3. Provide example workflow with minimum viable set
4. Note what's lost vs full agent roster

**Example**:
```markdown
### Minimum Viable Agent Set

For initial orchestration implementation:
- **Implementation**: Claude Code (claude) - best task input support
- **Review**: GitHub Codex (codex) - good for code review tasks
- **Fallback**: OpenCode (opencode) - alternative if above unavailable

This set enables basic autonomous workflow with cross-agent review.
```

### Subtask T041 – Propose Orchestrator Architecture

**Purpose**: Recommend how to implement the orchestrator.

**Architecture considerations**:
1. Process management (spawn subprocesses, track PIDs)
2. State tracking (WP status, agent assignment)
3. Dependency resolution (WP graph traversal)
4. Parallel execution (thread pool, async)
5. Failure handling (retry, fallback, abort)

**Steps**:
1. Propose high-level architecture
2. Identify key components:
   - Scheduler (assigns WPs to agents)
   - Executor (spawns agent processes)
   - Monitor (tracks completion, handles failures)
   - State Manager (persists orchestration state)
3. Recommend technology approach (Python subprocess, async, etc.)
4. Note integration points with existing spec-kitty code

**Keep it high-level** - this is research, not implementation design.

---

### Subtask T042 – Document Gaps and Future Research

**Purpose**: Identify what wasn't covered and what needs more investigation.

**Areas to address**:
1. Agents that couldn't be fully tested (why?)
2. Features that need deeper investigation
3. Edge cases not covered
4. Security considerations not addressed
5. Performance/scaling questions

**Steps**:
1. List gaps discovered during research
2. For each gap, note:
   - What's missing
   - Why it matters
   - Suggested follow-up action
3. Prioritize gaps (critical vs nice-to-have)

---

### Subtask T043 – Final Quality Gate Verification

**Purpose**: Ensure all success criteria from spec are met.

**Success Criteria from spec.md**:
- SC-001: Complete CLI capability matrix ✓/✗
- SC-002: Working example invocation for each CLI agent ✓/✗
- SC-003: Task specification method documented ✓/✗
- SC-004: Completion detection documented ✓/✗
- SC-005: Agent preference config schema proposed ✓/✗
- SC-006: Feasibility assessment complete ✓/✗
- SC-007: Architecture recommendation provided ✓/✗

**Steps**:
1. Review each success criterion
2. Mark as met or not met
3. For any not met, document why and if it's blocking
4. Provide final verdict on research completeness

---

### Subtask T044 – Update All Documentation Cross-References

**Purpose**: Ensure all documents link to each other properly.

**Steps**:
1. In `research.md`:
   - Link to spec.md, plan.md, data-model.md
   - Link to individual research files
2. In `data-model.md`:
   - Link to research.md for source data
   - Link to sample-agents.yaml
3. In each research file:
   - Ensure sources are properly linked
4. Update `tasks.md` status summary

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Findings may be disappointing | Document honestly, suggest alternatives |
| Recommendations too vague | Provide specific, actionable next steps |
