# Implementation Plan: Constitution Packaging Safety and Redesign

**Branch**: `011-constitution-packaging-safety-and-redesign` | **Date**: 2026-01-12 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `kitty-specs/011-constitution-packaging-safety-and-redesign/spec.md`

**Note**: This plan was created by `/spec-kitty.plan` command and validated through interactive discovery.

## Summary

Emergency 0.10.x release to resolve critical packaging safety issues and improve constitution system design. Four parallel goals: (1) Segregate template source code from project instances by moving all template sources from `.kittify/` to `src/specify_cli/`, preventing accidental packaging of development artifacts; (2) Redesign constitution as optional interactive command with phase-based discovery workflow (Technical → Quality → Tribal → Governance) and skip options; (3) Fix Windows dashboard ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE by refactoring to psutil for cross-platform process management; (4) Repair upgrade migration failures from 0.6.4+ by handling missing files gracefully.

**Critical Architectural Change**: Template sources move from `.kittify/` → `src/specify_cli/` to enable safe dogfooding. This eliminates packaging contamination at root cause.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (existing spec-kitty codebase requirement)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Existing: typer, rich, pyyaml, ruamel.yaml, httpx, pydantic
- **NEW**: psutil (cross-platform process/signal management for dashboard)

**Storage**: Filesystem only (templates in src/specify_cli/, user projects in .kittify/)
**Testing**: pytest (existing test suite), manual testing for migrations and packaging
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI (Linux, macOS, Windows 10/11)
**Project Type**: Single Python package with CLI entry points
**Performance Goals**: Migration execution <10s for typical project, dashboard startup <3s
**Constraints**:
- Backward compatibility for 0.6.4+ projects upgrading
- Zero breaking changes to user workflows
- Package size must not increase significantly

**Scale/Scope**:
- ~50+ files affected (Python code, templates, migrations, packaging config)
- 27 functional requirements across 4 major goals
- 2 parallel implementation tracks

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Status**: Constitution file exists but is template-only (not filled in for spec-kitty project). This feature affects the constitution system itself, so standard constitution checks don't apply.

**Governance Note**: This is a platform-critical feature requiring:
- Thorough testing of packaging (wheel inspection)
- Migration path validation (0.6.4 → 0.10.12 in clean environment)
- Cross-platform validation (Windows dashboard testing)
- No shortcuts on safety - this prevents contamination of public PyPI releases

**Constitution System Changes**: Removing mission-specific constitutions entirely, keeping only project-level `.kittify/memory/constitution.md`. This simplifies the architecture and removes confusion.

```

**Structure Decision**: Template sources move from `.kittify/` to `src/specify_cli/` to achieve clean separation between:
- **Template source code** (in src/, gets packaged, distributed via PyPI)
- **Project instances** (.kittify/ in any repo, never packaged)

This enables spec-kitty developers to safely run `spec-kitty init` and use all commands for dogfooding without risk of packaging their filled-in artifacts.

## Complexity Tracking

*This feature has no constitution violations - it's a safety and quality improvement.*

| Complexity Area | Justification |
|-----------------|---------------|
| Large scope (50+ files) | Necessary to fix critical safety issue and unblock Windows users |
| Major refactoring (template relocation) | Root cause fix for packaging contamination, prevents future issues |
| Cross-platform testing required | Dashboard must work on Windows, not just POSIX systems |
| Migration compatibility testing | Must not break existing users upgrading from 0.6.4+ |

## Parallel Work Analysis

This feature has 2 independent implementation tracks that can proceed in parallel:

### Work Distribution

**Track 1: Critical Safety (Priority P0)**
- **Focus**: Packaging fixes and migration repairs
- **Key files**:
  - `src/specify_cli/template/manager.py` (template loading)
  - `pyproject.toml` (force-includes removal)
  - `src/specify_cli/upgrade/migrations/*.py` (4 migration fixes + 1 new)
  - `src/specify_cli/mission.py` (remove constitution_dir)
  - `src/specify_cli/manifest.py` (remove constitution scanning)
- **No conflicts with Track 2**

**Track 2: UX Improvements (Priority P1)**
- **Focus**: Constitution redesign and Windows dashboard
- **Key files**:
  - `.kittify/templates/command-templates/constitution.md` → `src/specify_cli/templates/command-templates/constitution.md` (after Track 1 moves it)
  - `src/specify_cli/dashboard/lifecycle.py` (psutil refactor)
  - `src/specify_cli/cli/commands/init.py` (help text update)
  - `pyproject.toml` (add psutil dependency)
- **Minimal overlap with Track 1** (both touch pyproject.toml but different sections)

**Sequential Foundation (Must complete first)**:
- Phase 0 research (psutil patterns, template relocation strategy)
- Phase 1 design (data model, migration entities)

**Sequential Integration (Must complete last)**:
- Package build and inspection test
- Full migration path test (0.6.4 → 0.10.12)
- Cross-platform validation

### Coordination Points

**Sync Point 1 (After template relocation)**:
- Track 1 completes template move to `src/specify_cli/`
- Track 2 can then update constitution command template in new location
- Merge Track 1 changes first, then Track 2 rebases

**Sync Point 2 (Before integration testing)**:
- Both tracks complete their implementation
- Integration testing verifies all 4 goals work together
- Package build test ensures nothing was accidentally included

**Conflict Resolution**:
- `pyproject.toml`: Track 1 removes force-includes (lines 86-110), Track 2 adds psutil dependency (line ~20). Different sections, no conflict.
- Templates: Track 1 moves entire directory first, Track 2 updates specific file content after. Sequential, no conflict.
- No other file conflicts identified.

## Risk Mitigation

**Risk 1: Template relocation breaks existing code**
- Mitigation: Comprehensive grep for `.kittify/` references, update all to use package resources
- Test: Build package, run `spec-kitty init` from installed package

**Risk 2: Migration fails on edge cases**
- Mitigation: Test with actual 0.6.4 project, not just mocked migrations
- Test: Create VM with 0.6.4, upgrade to 0.10.12, verify all migrations pass

**Risk 3: Windows dashboard still broken after psutil refactor**
- Mitigation: Test on actual Windows 10/11 system, not just WSL
- Test: Dashboard starts, serves HTML, handles shutdown gracefully

**Risk 4: Packaging still includes wrong files**
- Mitigation: Automated test that extracts wheel and asserts no `.kittify/memory/` or filled constitution
- Test: `unzip -l dist/*.whl | grep -E '(constitution.md|memory/)' | wc -l` should be 0 (except templates)
