## ⚠️ Dependency Rebase Guidance

**This WP depends on**: WP01 (Mission Infrastructure)

**Before starting work**:
1. Ensure WP01 is complete
2. Mission directory exists: `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/`
3. Templates directory exists: `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/templates/`

---

## Objectives & Success Criteria

**Goal**: Create the four Divio documentation type templates (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation) with comprehensive guidance following Write the Docs best practices and Divio principles.

**Success Criteria**:
- Four template files created in `templates/divio/` subdirectory
- Each template has YAML frontmatter with `type` field
- Each template has section structure appropriate to its Divio type
- Templates include Write the Docs guidance (accessibility, bias-free language, clear structure)
- Templates have placeholders for project-specific content
- Each template clearly explains its purpose and when to use it
- Templates load successfully via `Mission.get_template()`
- Templates enable users to create high-quality documentation without prior Divio knowledge

## Context & Constraints

**Prerequisites**:
- WP01 complete: Mission directory structure exists
- Understanding of Divio documentation system from research

**Reference Documents**:
- [research.md](../research.md) - Divio documentation types (lines 87-210)
  - Tutorial research (lines 87-105)
  - How-to research (lines 107-125)
  - Reference research (lines 127-145)
  - Explanation research (lines 147-165)
- [data-model.md](../data-model.md) - Divio Documentation Type entity (lines 93-157)

**Steps**:
1. Create `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/templates/divio/` directory
2. Add `.gitkeep` if needed (though templates will be added immediately)
3. Verify directory structure:
   ```
   src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/
   └── templates/
       ├── spec-template.md
       ├── plan-template.md
       ├── tasks-template.md
       ├── task-prompt-template.md
       └── divio/               # NEW
           ├── tutorial-template.md
           ├── howto-template.md
           ├── reference-template.md

**Files**: `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/templates/divio/explanation-template.md` (new file)

**Parallel?**: Yes (can be created alongside other Divio templates)

**Notes**:
- Explanation is about understanding, not doing
- Not required reading (for those curious about "why")
- Discusses concepts, design decisions, trade-offs
- Makes connections between ideas
- Compares with alternatives

**Quality Validation**:
- Does it explain "why" and "how it works"?
- Are design decisions and their rationale clear?
- Are alternatives discussed fairly?
- Are trade-offs and limitations identified?
- Does it help readers understand, not do?

### Subtask T017 – Add Write the Docs Guidance

**Purpose**: Ensure all four Divio templates include Write the Docs best practices for accessibility and bias-free language.

**Steps**:
1. Review all four templates (tutorial, how-to, reference, explanation)
2. Ensure each template includes:

**Accessibility Guidance**:
```markdown
**Accessibility Checklist**:
- [ ] Proper heading hierarchy (one H1, then H2, then H3 - no skipping levels)
- [ ] All images have descriptive alt text explaining what they show
- [ ] All code blocks have language tags for syntax highlighting
- [ ] Clear, plain language (avoid jargon or define technical terms)
- [ ] Links have descriptive text (not "click here")
- [ ] Tables have proper headers
- [ ] Lists are properly formatted (not paragraphs with commas)
```

**Bias-Free Language Guidance**:
```markdown
**Inclusivity Checklist**:
- [ ] Examples use diverse names (not just Western male names)
- [ ] Gender-neutral language ("they" not "he/she")
- [ ] No cultural assumptions (avoid idioms, religious references, cultural-specific examples)
- [ ] Welcoming tone (not intimidating or assuming knowledge)
- [ ] Avoid ableist language ("just", "simply", "obviously", "easy")
- [ ] Person-first language where appropriate
```

**Clear Language Guidance**:
```markdown
**Clarity Checklist**:
- [ ] Active voice ("run the command" not "the command should be run")
- [ ] Present tense ("returns" not "will return")
- [ ] Direct address ("you" addressing the reader)
- [ ] One idea per sentence
- [ ] Short paragraphs (3-5 sentences max)
- [ ] Concrete examples, not abstract descriptions
```

3. Add these sections to the "Writing Guide" at the bottom of each template
4. Include inline reminders in appropriate sections:
   - Before screenshot examples: reminder about alt text
   - Before example names: reminder about diverse names
   - Before code blocks: reminder about language tags

**Files**:
- `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/templates/divio/tutorial-template.md` (modified)
- `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/templates/divio/howto-template.md` (modified)
- `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/templates/divio/reference-template.md` (modified)
- `src/specify_cli/missions/documentation/templates/divio/explanation-template.md` (modified)

**Parallel?**: Yes (can be done while creating templates or immediately after)

**Notes**:
- Write the Docs guidance should be woven throughout templates
- Checklists help authors verify their work
- Inline reminders catch issues early
- This is not optional - accessibility and inclusivity are requirements

**Quality Validation**:
- Are checklists present in all four templates?
- Are reminders placed at relevant points?
- Is guidance actionable (not vague)?
- Do examples in the templates themselves follow these guidelines?

### Subtask T018 – Add Content Placeholders

**Purpose**: Ensure all four Divio templates have appropriate placeholders that guide users on what content to provide.

**Steps**:
1. Review all four templates
2. Add placeholders in these formats:
   - `{placeholder_name}` - Simple replacement (e.g., {project_name})
   - `[Description of what goes here]` - Guidance for content blocks
   - `[EXAMPLE: ...]` - Show what good content looks like
3. Ensure placeholders cover:

**Common Placeholders** (all templates):
```markdown
{project_name}          # Project or product name
{component_name}        # Specific component being documented
{target_audience}       # Who this is for
{date}                  # Creation/update date
{author}                # Document author
```

**Tutorial-Specific Placeholders**:
```markdown
{goal}                  # What learner will accomplish
{duration}              # Estimated completion time
{prerequisites}         # Required knowledge/tools
{step_action}           # Action in each step
{expected_output}       # What learner should see
{concrete_accomplishment}  # What they've achieved
```

**How-To-Specific Placeholders**:
```markdown
{problem_description}   # Problem being solved
{solution_summary}      # Quick summary of approach
{required_knowledge}    # Assumed expertise
{action_step}           # Each step in solution
{variation_scenario}    # Alternative situations
```

**Reference-Specific Placeholders**:
```markdown
{api_module_cli}        # Type of reference (API/CLI/Config)
{component_status}      # Stable/Beta/Deprecated
{option_name}           # CLI option or config setting
{parameter_type}        # Data type
{default_value}         # Default setting
{description}           # Technical description
```

**Explanation-Specific Placeholders**:
```markdown
{concept}               # Concept being explained
{why_it_matters}        # Value of understanding
{problem_context}       # Problem that led to this
{design_rationale}      # Why designed this way
{alternative_approach}  # Other options considered
{trade_off}             # Accepted limitations
```

4. Add examples showing good vs. bad placeholder usage:
```markdown
## Example Placeholders

✓ Good:
```markdown
## Step 1: Install {project_name}

Download {project_name} from [link] and run:
```bash
npm install {project_name}
```
```

✗ Bad:
```markdown
## Step 1: Install the software

Download it and install.
```
(Too vague - doesn't guide the author)
```

**Files**:
- All four Divio templates (modified with placeholders)

**Parallel?**: Yes (can be done alongside template creation)

**Notes**:
- Placeholders make templates immediately useful
- Good placeholders guide authors on what content is needed
- Include examples of good content to set expectations
- Placeholders should be discoverable (obvious what to replace)

**Quality Validation**:
- Are all section

s that need content marked with placeholders?
- Are placeholders descriptive (clear what goes there)?
- Do examples show good content?
- Are common mistakes highlighted?

## Test Strategy

**Unit Tests** (to be implemented in WP09):

1. Test Divio templates exist:
   ```python
   def test_divio_templates_exist():
       mission = get_mission_by_name("documentation")
       templates = mission.list_templates()

       assert "divio/tutorial-template.md" in templates
       assert "divio/howto-template.md" in templates
       assert "divio/reference-template.md" in templates
       assert "divio/explanation-template.md" in templates
   ```

2. Test each template has frontmatter with type field:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.parametrize("template_name,expected_type", [
       ("divio/tutorial-template.md", "tutorial"),
       ("divio/howto-template.md", "how-to"),
       ("divio/reference-template.md", "reference"),
       ("divio/explanation-template.md", "explanation"),
   ])
   def test_divio_template_frontmatter(template_name, expected_type):
       mission = get_mission_by_name("documentation")
       template = mission.get_template(template_name)
       content = template.read_text()

       # Parse frontmatter
       assert content.startswith("---")
       frontmatter = parse_yaml_frontmatter(content)
       assert frontmatter["type"] == expected_type
   ```

3. Test templates have required sections:
   ```python
   def test_tutorial_template_structure():
       mission = get_mission_by_name("documentation")
       template = mission.get_template("divio/tutorial-template.md")
       content = template.read_text()

       # Check for required sections
       assert "## What You'll Learn" in content
       assert "## Before You Begin" in content
       assert "## Step 1:" in content
       assert "## What You've Accomplished" in content
       assert "## Next Steps" in content
   ```

4. Test templates include Write the Docs guidance:
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.parametrize("template_name", [
       "divio/tutorial-template.md",
       "divio/howto-template.md",
       "divio/reference-template.md",
       "divio/explanation-template.md",
   ])
   def test_divio_template_accessibility_guidance(template_name):
       mission = get_mission_by_name("documentation")
       template = mission.get_template(template_name)
       content = template.read_text()

       assert "Accessibility Checklist" in content
       assert "Inclusivity Checklist" in content
       assert "alt text" in content.lower()
       assert "heading hierarchy" in content.lower()
   ```

**Manual Validation**:

1. Read each template as a documentation author:
   - Is it clear what type of documentation this is for?
   - Are the sections appropriate for this Divio type?
   - Do the placeholders guide you on what to write?
   - Is the guidance helpful?

2. Validate against Divio principles:
   - Tutorial: Learning-oriented, step-by-step?
   - How-To: Goal-oriented, problem-solving?
   - Reference: Information-oriented, complete?
   - Explanation: Understanding-oriented, conceptual?

3. Check accessibility guidance:
   - Are checklists comprehensive?
   - Are they actionable?
   - Are examples clear?

4. Test template loading:
   ```python
   from specify_cli.mission import get_mission_by_name

   mission = get_mission_by_name("documentation")

   # Load each Divio template
   for template_name in ["tutorial", "howto", "reference", "explanation"]:
       template_path = mission.get_template(f"divio/{template_name}-template.md")
       print(f"✓ {template_name} template loads successfully")
   ```

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Templates too prescriptive | Medium - stifles creativity | Provide guidance but allow flexibility in content |
| Templates too vague | High - authors don't know what to write | Include examples and detailed placeholders |
| Mixing Divio types | High - confuses users | Clear distinctions, examples of what NOT to do |
| Missing accessibility guidance | High - inaccessible docs | Comprehensive checklists, inline reminders |
| Templates too long | Medium - intimidating | Sections are optional, core structure is minimal |
| Not following Divio principles | High - defeats purpose | Validate against research, test with users |
