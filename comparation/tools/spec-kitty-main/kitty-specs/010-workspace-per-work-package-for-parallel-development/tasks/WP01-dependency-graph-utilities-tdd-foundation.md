# Work Package Prompt: WP01 – Dependency Graph Utilities (TDD Foundation)

**Implementation command:**
```bash
spec-kitty implement WP01
```

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Review Feedback Status

**Read this first if you are implementing this task!**

- **Has review feedback?**: Check the `review_status` field above. If it says `has_feedback`, scroll to the **Review Feedback** section immediately.
- **You must address all feedback** before your work is complete.
- **Mark as acknowledged**: Update `review_status: acknowledged` when you begin addressing feedback.

## Review Feedback

> **Populated by `/spec-kitty.review`** – Reviewers add detailed feedback here when work needs changes.

*[This section is empty initially. Reviewers will populate it if needed.]*

---

## Objectives & Success Criteria

**Primary Goal**: Create `src/specify_cli/core/dependency_graph.py` module with utilities for parsing WP dependencies, detecting circular dependencies, and validating dependency graphs.

**Success Criteria**:
- ✅ All unit tests pass (T001-T005)
- ✅ dependency_graph.py module implements all required functions
- ✅ Cycle detection works correctly for various graph shapes (no cycles, simple cycles, complex DAGs)
- ✅ Test coverage >90% for dependency_graph.py

**TDD Mandate**: Tests must be written FIRST (T001-T005), should FAIL initially, then implementation (T006) makes them pass.

---

## Context & Constraints

**Why this WP matters**: Dependency graph utilities are foundational for the entire workspace-per-WP feature. Without correct cycle detection and validation, we could generate invalid task structures or allow users to create dependent workspaces in wrong order.

**Reference Documents**:
- [plan.md](../plan.md) - Section 1.3: Dependency Graph Utilities (function signatures)
- [data-model.md](../data-model.md) - DependencyGraph entity definition, cycle detection algorithm
- [spec.md](../spec.md) - FR-012 through FR-015 (dependency validation requirements)

**Constitutional Alignment**:
- Principle V (File-Based Everything): Dependencies stored in WP frontmatter, parsed from files
- Technical Standards: Python 3.11+, type hints required, pytest for testing

**Constraints**:
- Must work with YAML frontmatter (ruamel.yaml parser)
- Performance: <100ms for 50 WPs, <500ms cycle detection for complex graphs
- No external dependencies beyond existing Spec Kitty stack

---

## Subtasks & Detailed Guidance

### Subtask T001 – Write tests for dependency parsing

**Purpose**: Validate parse_wp_dependencies() reads dependencies from WP frontmatter correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Create `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`
2. Write test cases for parse_wp_dependencies():
   - Test parsing WP with no dependencies (empty list)
   - Test parsing WP with single dependency
   - Test parsing WP with multiple dependencies
   - Test parsing WP with missing dependencies field (defaults to [])
   - Test parsing invalid frontmatter (error handling)

**Files**: `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`

**Parallel?**: Can run in parallel with T002-T005 (different test functions)

**Example Test**:
```python
def test_parse_wp_dependencies_single():
    """Test parsing WP with single dependency."""
    wp_content = """---
work_package_id: "WP02"
dependencies: ["WP01"]
---
# Content
"""
    wp_file = tmp_path / "WP02.md"
    wp_file.write_text(wp_content)

    deps = parse_wp_dependencies(wp_file)
    assert deps == ["WP01"]
```

---

### Subtask T002 – Write tests for graph building

**Purpose**: Validate build_dependency_graph() scans all WPs and creates correct adjacency list.

**Steps**:
1. In `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`, add test cases for build_dependency_graph()
2. Test cases:
   - Empty feature (no WPs) → empty graph
   - Single WP with no dependencies → {"WP01": []}
   - Linear chain: WP01 → WP02 → WP03
   - Fan-out: WP01 → [WP02, WP03, WP04]
   - Complex DAG (diamond pattern)

**Files**: `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`

**Parallel?**: Yes, can write in parallel with T001, T003-T005

**Example Test**:
```python
def test_build_graph_linear_chain(tmp_path):
    """Test graph building with linear dependency chain."""
    feature_dir = tmp_path / "kitty-specs" / "010-feature"
    tasks_dir = feature_dir / "tasks"
    tasks_dir.mkdir(parents=True)

    # Create WP01 (no deps)
    (tasks_dir / "WP01.md").write_text("---\nwork_package_id: WP01\ndependencies: []\n---")
    # Create WP02 (depends on WP01)
    (tasks_dir / "WP02.md").write_text("---\nwork_package_id: WP02\ndependencies: [WP01]\n---")

    graph = build_dependency_graph(feature_dir)
    assert graph == {"WP01": [], "WP02": ["WP01"]}
```

---

### Subtask T003 – Write tests for cycle detection

**Purpose**: Validate detect_cycles() correctly identifies circular dependencies using DFS algorithm.

**Steps**:
1. Add test cases for detect_cycles() to test_dependency_graph.py
2. Test cases:
   - Acyclic graph (no cycles) → returns None
   - Simple cycle: WP01 → WP02 → WP01
   - Self-dependency: WP01 → WP01
   - Complex cycle: WP01 → WP02 → WP03 → WP01
   - Multiple cycles in same graph

**Files**: `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`

**Parallel?**: Yes, independent test function

**Example Test**:
```python
def test_detect_cycles_simple():
    """Test detection of simple circular dependency."""
    graph = {"WP01": ["WP02"], "WP02": ["WP01"]}
    cycles = detect_cycles(graph)

    assert cycles is not None
    assert len(cycles) == 1
    # Cycle should be ["WP01", "WP02", "WP01"] or similar
    assert "WP01" in cycles[0] and "WP02" in cycles[0]

def test_detect_cycles_none():
    """Test acyclic graph returns None."""
    graph = {"WP01": [], "WP02": ["WP01"], "WP03": ["WP01"]}
    cycles = detect_cycles(graph)
    assert cycles is None
```

---

### Subtask T004 – Write tests for dependency validation

**Purpose**: Validate validate_dependencies() catches invalid dependencies (missing WPs, self-deps, etc.).

**Steps**:
1. Add test cases for validate_dependencies()
2. Test cases:
   - Valid dependencies → (True, [])
   - Missing dependency (WP99 doesn't exist) → (False, ["WP99 not found"])
   - Self-dependency (WP01 depends on WP01) → (False, ["Cannot depend on self"])
   - Circular dependency → (False, ["Circular dependency detected"])
   - Invalid WP ID format ("WP1" instead of "WP01") → (False, ["Invalid WP ID"])

**Files**: `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`

**Parallel?**: Yes, independent test function

**Example Test**:
```python
def test_validate_dependencies_missing():
    """Test validation catches missing dependencies."""
    graph = {"WP01": [], "WP02": ["WP01"]}
    is_valid, errors = validate_dependencies("WP03", ["WP99"], graph)

    assert is_valid is False
    assert any("WP99" in err for err in errors)
```

---

### Subtask T005 – Write tests for dependent lookup

**Purpose**: Validate get_dependents() correctly finds WPs that depend on a given WP (inverse graph query).

**Steps**:
1. Add test cases for get_dependents()
2. Test cases:
   - WP with no dependents → []
   - WP with single dependent → ["WP02"]
   - WP with multiple dependents (fan-out) → ["WP02", "WP03", "WP04"]
   - Query non-existent WP → []

**Files**: `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`

**Parallel?**: Yes, independent test function

**Example Test**:
```python
def test_get_dependents_fan_out():
    """Test finding dependents in fan-out pattern."""
    graph = {
        "WP01": [],
        "WP02": ["WP01"],
        "WP03": ["WP01"],
        "WP04": ["WP01"]
    }
    dependents = get_dependents("WP01", graph)
    assert set(dependents) == {"WP02", "WP03", "WP04"}
```

---

### Subtask T006 – Implement dependency_graph.py module

**Purpose**: Create the actual implementation to make all tests (T001-T005) pass.

**Steps**:
1. Create `src/specify_cli/core/dependency_graph.py`
2. Implement functions in order:
   - `parse_wp_dependencies(wp_file: Path) -> list[str]`
   - `build_dependency_graph(feature_dir: Path) -> dict[str, list[str]]`
   - `detect_cycles(graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> list[list[str]] | None`
   - `validate_dependencies(wp_id: str, declared_deps: list[str], graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> tuple[bool, list[str]]`
   - `get_dependents(wp_id: str, graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> list[str]`
3. Use ruamel.yaml for frontmatter parsing (consistent with existing code)
4. Implement DFS cycle detection per data-model.md algorithm
5. Add type hints for all functions (Python 3.11+)
6. Run tests - verify all pass

**Files**: `src/specify_cli/core/dependency_graph.py`

**Implementation Details**:

**parse_wp_dependencies**:
```python
def parse_wp_dependencies(wp_file: Path) -> list[str]:
    """Parse dependencies from WP frontmatter."""
    from ruamel.yaml import YAML
    yaml = YAML()

    with open(wp_file) as f:
        content = f.read()
        # Split frontmatter from content
        if not content.startswith('---'):
            return []

        parts = content.split('---', 2)
        if len(parts) < 3:
            return []

        frontmatter = yaml.load(parts[1])
        return frontmatter.get('dependencies', [])
```

**detect_cycles (DFS)**:
```python
def detect_cycles(graph: dict[str, list[str]]) -> list[list[str]] | None:
    """Detect circular dependencies using DFS with coloring."""
    WHITE, GRAY, BLACK = 0, 1, 2
    color = {wp: WHITE for wp in graph}
    cycles = []

    def dfs(node: str, path: list[str]) -> None:
        color[node] = GRAY
        path.append(node)

        for neighbor in graph.get(node, []):
            if color.get(neighbor, WHITE) == GRAY:
                # Back edge - cycle found
                cycle_start = path.index(neighbor)
                cycles.append(path[cycle_start:] + [neighbor])
            elif color.get(neighbor, WHITE) == WHITE:
                dfs(neighbor, path)

        path.pop()
        color[node] = BLACK

    for wp in graph:
        if color[wp] == WHITE:
            dfs(wp, [])

    return cycles if cycles else None
```

**Parallel?**: No (implements all functions sequentially)

**Notes**: Follow existing Spec Kitty patterns (pathlib for paths, type hints, docstrings)

---

### Subtask T007 – Verify test coverage

**Purpose**: Ensure dependency_graph.py has >90% test coverage.

**Steps**:
1. Run pytest with coverage: `pytest tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py --cov=src/specify_cli/core/dependency_graph.py --cov-report=term-missing`
2. Review coverage report, identify untested lines
3. Add tests for uncovered branches (error paths, edge cases)
4. Re-run until coverage >90%

**Files**: N/A (validation step)

**Success**: Coverage report shows >90% for dependency_graph.py

---

## Test Strategy

**All tests in**: `tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py`

**Test execution**:
```bash
# Run from current worktree (where new code lives)
pytest tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py -v
pytest tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py --cov=src/specify_cli/core/dependency_graph.py --cov-report=term-missing
```

**Expected initial state**: All tests FAIL (module doesn't exist yet)
**After T006**: All tests PASS

**Note**: Do NOT cd to main repo - tests must run against code in this worktree.

**Test categories**:
- Parsing tests (T001): 5 test cases
- Graph building tests (T002): 5 test cases
- Cycle detection tests (T003): 5 test cases
- Validation tests (T004): 5 test cases
- Dependent lookup tests (T005): 4 test cases

**Total**: ~24 unit tests for dependency_graph.py

---

## Risks & Mitigations

**Risk 1: Cycle detection algorithm incorrect**
- Impact: Invalid dependency graphs allowed → runtime errors during implement
- Mitigation: Comprehensive test cases covering all graph topologies, reference DFS algorithm from data-model.md

**Risk 2: Frontmatter parsing inconsistent with existing code**
- Impact: Can't parse WP files → dependency tracking broken
- Mitigation: Use same ruamel.yaml approach as existing frontmatter.py module, test with real WP file examples

**Risk 3: Performance degradation with large graphs**
- Impact: Slow cycle detection for features with many WPs
- Mitigation: DFS is O(V+E), test with 50 WPs, verify <500ms constraint

---

## Definition of Done Checklist

- [ ] Test file created: tests/specify_cli/test_dependency_graph.py
