## Validation Results

### Content Quality ✅

**No implementation details**: PASS - Specification describes workspace creation, dependency handling, and merge behavior without mentioning specific Python modules, classes, or data structures.

**User value focus**: PASS - Executive summary and user stories clearly articulate the problem (sequential development bottleneck) and solution (parallel multi-agent work).

**Stakeholder language**: PASS - Written for users and project managers (agents, worktrees, dependencies) rather than developers (git_ops.py, subprocess calls, pathlib).

**Mandatory sections**: PASS - All required sections present: User Scenarios (6 stories), Requirements (25 FRs), Success Criteria (10 measurable outcomes), Edge Cases (11 scenarios).

### Requirement Completeness ✅

**No clarifications pending**: PASS - "Open Questions" section explicitly states all decisions resolved during discovery. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers in spec.

**Testable requirements**: PASS - All 25 functional requirements use concrete verbs (MUST create, MUST validate, MUST commit) with specific validation criteria.

**Measurable success criteria**: PASS - All 10 success criteria include quantifiable validation (100% error rate, git log verification, 1/3 time reduction, etc.).

**Technology-agnostic success criteria**: PASS - Success criteria focus on user outcomes (parallel work, dependency correctness, backward compatibility) without mentioning implementation specifics.

**Acceptance scenarios defined**: PASS - 6 user stories with 22 total acceptance scenarios covering primary flows (parallel work, dependencies, planning workflow) and edge cases (review feedback, legacy compatibility).

**Edge cases identified**: PASS - 11 edge case scenarios across 4 categories (workspace creation failures, dependency validation, planning artifact workflow, legacy/new model detection) with explicit resolutions.

**Scope boundaries**: PASS - Clear in-scope/out-of-scope sections. Notable out-of-scope: incremental WP merging, dashboard implementation, automatic rebase, dependency visualization.

**Dependencies listed**: PASS - 3 external dependencies (Git CLI 2.5.0+, Python 3.11+, existing Git repo) and 5 key assumptions (main branch target, worktree support, filesystem isolation, DAG dependencies, external agent coordination).

### Feature Readiness ✅

**Requirements with acceptance criteria**: PASS - Each of 25 functional requirements maps directly to acceptance scenarios in user stories 1-6. Example: FR-007 (--base flag) validated by User Story 2, Scenario 2.

**Primary flows covered**: PASS - User stories prioritized correctly: P1 (parallel development, dependency handling, planning workflow, WP prompts), P2 (backward compatibility), P3 (review warnings).

**Measurable outcomes aligned**: PASS - Success criteria directly validate user story scenarios. SC-001 (parallel work) validates User Story 1, SC-003 (correct branching) validates User Story 2.

**No implementation leakage**: PASS - Spec avoids Python code, function names, module structure, or specific library references.

## Notes

**Strengths**:

1. **Clear problem statement**: Executive summary articulates current bottleneck (one worktree per feature) and solution (workspace-per-WP for parallel work).

2. **Comprehensive dependency handling**: User Story 2 and FR-007/FR-008 fully specify --base flag behavior, validation, and error handling.

3. **Backward compatibility designed upfront**: User Story 5 and FR-022 through FR-025 ensure legacy worktrees (features 001-008) continue working.

4. **Dashboard compatibility considered**: SC-008 and edge cases acknowledge dashboard must handle both models, setting up future dashboard feature.

5. **Review feedback warnings**: User Story 6 addresses git limitation (manual rebase required) with explicit warnings in prompts, setting expectations correctly.

6. **Self-documenting WP prompts**: FR-010/FR-011 specify WP prompt files contain correct implementation commands, reducing user error.

**Design Decisions Validated**:

- ✅ Planning artifacts in main (FR-001 through FR-003) - enables all WPs to branch from common base
- ✅ On-demand workspace creation (FR-004) - only creates workspaces actually needed
- ✅ --base flag for explicit dependencies (FR-007) - prevents accidental wrong branching
- ✅ Keep existing merge behavior (FR-019) - incremental merging deferred to future version
- ✅ Non-retroactive (FR-025) - legacy worktrees frozen, no forced migration

**Risk Mitigation**:

- High risk: Breaking change to planning workflow - Mitigation: Clear docs, updated prompts
- High risk: Dependency detection accuracy - Mitigation: Conservative parsing, validation
- Medium risk: Review feedback rebase complexity - Mitigation: Prominent warnings
- Medium risk: Dashboard compatibility - Mitigation: Explicit detection logic

**Ready for Next Phase**: ✅ This specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/spec-kitty.plan` (design/architecture phase).

**Recommendation**: Proceed to planning phase to design:
- Worktree creation logic (when to create, validation, error handling)
- Dependency parsing from tasks.md (detection algorithm, circular dependency checks)
- Planning workflow changes (commit to main, no initial worktree)
- Backward compatibility detection (legacy vs new model)
- Warning system for review feedback (when to display, what commands to suggest)
