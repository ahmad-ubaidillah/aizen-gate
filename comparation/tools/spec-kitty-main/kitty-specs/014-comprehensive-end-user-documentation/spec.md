# Feature Specification: Comprehensive End-User Documentation

**Feature Branch**: `014-comprehensive-end-user-documentation`
**Created**: 2026-01-16
**Status**: Draft
**Mission**: documentation
**Input**: User description: "a documentation mission that replaces this project's current documentation with a fresh, comprehensive, professional documentation that covers all use cases and all 4 types of docs."

## Overview

Create fresh, comprehensive, professional documentation for spec-kitty targeting **end users** (people using spec-kitty to manage their project specifications). The documentation will follow the Divio 4-type documentation system and replace all existing documentation after auditing it for any salvageable content.

### Target Audience

- **Primary**: End users of spec-kitty who want to use the tool for their own projects
- **Excluded**: Contributors/developers extending spec-kitty itself (internal documentation)

### Approach

1. **Audit existing documentation** to identify content worth preserving
2. **Remove all outdated or ill-fitting material** - no legacy cruft
3. **Build fresh documentation** following Divio 4-type structure
4. **Result**: Cohesive, professional documentation set

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - First-Time User Learns Spec-Kitty (Priority: P1)

A developer discovers spec-kitty and wants to understand what it does and how to get started. They need a clear learning path that takes them from zero knowledge to successfully using spec-kitty on a real project.

**Why this priority**: Without a clear onboarding path, users abandon the tool before experiencing its value. Tutorials are the gateway to adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a new user follow the tutorial from start to finish and successfully create their first feature specification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer with no prior spec-kitty experience, **When** they follow the Getting Started tutorial, **Then** they successfully install spec-kitty and create their first feature specification within 30 minutes.
2. **Given** a user completing the introductory tutorial, **When** they want to learn more, **Then** they find clear links to the next tutorials in the learning path.
3. **Given** a user following a tutorial, **When** they encounter an error, **Then** the tutorial includes troubleshooting guidance for common issues.

### User Story 2 - User Solves a Specific Problem (Priority: P1)

An active spec-kitty user needs to accomplish a specific task (e.g., "How do I review a work package?", "How do I handle dependencies between work packages?"). They need quick, task-focused instructions without reading background material.

**Why this priority**: Users spend most of their time solving specific problems. How-to guides directly impact daily productivity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a user with a specific goal find and follow the relevant how-to guide to accomplish their task.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user who needs to perform a specific task, **When** they search the documentation, **Then** they find a how-to guide that addresses their exact need within 2 minutes.
2. **Given** a user following a how-to guide, **When** they complete the steps, **Then** they achieve the stated goal without needing additional resources.
3. **Given** a user reading a how-to guide, **When** they need related information, **Then** cross-references point them to relevant how-tos, reference docs, or explanations.

---

### User Story 3 - User Looks Up Command Details (Priority: P2)

A user knows what command or feature they need but wants to check exact syntax, available flags, or behavior details. They need accurate, complete reference material.

**Why this priority**: Reference documentation supports confident, correct usage. Users who already know what they need should find precise answers quickly.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a user look up any spec-kitty command and find complete, accurate documentation for it.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user who needs command syntax, **When** they consult the reference documentation, **Then** they find complete information including all flags, options, and examples.
2. **Given** a user checking reference docs, **When** they read a command description, **Then** the documented behavior matches the actual tool behavior.
3. **Given** a user browsing reference docs, **When** they need context for why something works a certain way, **Then** they find links to relevant explanation articles.

---

### User Story 4 - User Understands the "Why" (Priority: P2)

A user wants to understand spec-kitty's design philosophy, the reasoning behind the workspace-per-work-package model, or why missions work the way they do. They need conceptual explanations that build mental models.

**Why this priority**: Understanding the "why" enables users to make better decisions and use the tool more effectively. Explanations turn users into experts.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having a user read an explanation article and then correctly explain the concept to someone else.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user confused about a spec-kitty concept, **When** they read the relevant explanation, **Then** they understand the reasoning and can apply the concept correctly.
2. **Given** a user reading an explanation, **When** they want to try it out, **Then** they find links to relevant tutorials and how-to guides.
3. **Given** a user who has read an explanation, **When** they encounter related decisions in their work, **Then** they can make informed choices based on their understanding.

---

### User Story 5 - User Navigates Documentation Efficiently (Priority: P3)

A user (new or experienced) needs to find information quickly. The documentation structure should be intuitive, searchable, and well-organized.

**Why this priority**: Even excellent content fails if users cannot find it. Navigation and discoverability are foundational.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by having users with different goals find their target content using navigation, search, or cross-references.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user arriving at the documentation, **When** they view the landing page, **Then** they understand the documentation structure and where to find different types of content.
2. **Given** a user looking for specific information, **When** they use documentation search or navigation, **Then** they find relevant content within 3 clicks or searches.
3. **Given** a user reading any documentation page, **When** they want related content, **Then** cross-references guide them to logical next steps.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user follows a tutorial but has an older version of spec-kitty?
- How does the documentation handle features that differ between missions (software-dev vs. research vs. documentation)?
- What if a user searches for a term that appears in multiple Divio types?
- How should the documentation handle deprecated features or breaking changes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Audit & Cleanup**
- **FR-001**: Documentation team MUST audit all existing documentation files before creating new content
- **FR-002**: All outdated, redundant, or ill-fitting documentation MUST be removed
- **FR-003**: Any valuable content from existing docs MUST be migrated to the appropriate Divio type

**Divio Structure**
- **FR-004**: Documentation MUST include Tutorials (learning-oriented, step-by-step guides)
- **FR-005**: Documentation MUST include How-To Guides (task-oriented, problem-solving recipes)
- **FR-006**: Documentation MUST include Reference (complete, accurate command/feature descriptions)
- **FR-007**: Documentation MUST include Explanations (concept-oriented, "why" discussions)

**Content Quality**
- **FR-008**: Each documentation page MUST clearly indicate its Divio type
- **FR-009**: Cross-references MUST link related content across Divio types
- **FR-010**: All command documentation MUST include working examples
- **FR-011**: Tutorials MUST be testable end-to-end by a new user

**Coverage**
- **FR-012**: Documentation MUST cover all spec-kitty slash commands (specify, plan, tasks, implement, review, accept, merge, status, etc.)
- **FR-013**: Documentation MUST cover all three missions (software-dev, research, documentation)
- **FR-014**: Documentation MUST explain the workspace-per-work-package model
- **FR-015**: Documentation MUST explain dependency handling between work packages

**Navigation & Discoverability**
- **FR-016**: Documentation MUST have a clear landing page with navigation to all Divio types
- **FR-017**: Documentation MUST have consistent navigation structure across all pages

### Key Entities

- **Documentation Page**: A single markdown file covering one topic, classified by Divio type
- **Divio Type**: One of four documentation categories (Tutorial, How-To, Reference, Explanation)
- **Cross-Reference**: A link connecting related content across different pages or Divio types
- **Landing Page**: The documentation entry point with navigation to all sections

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A new user can complete the Getting Started tutorial and create their first feature specification within 30 minutes
- **SC-002**: Users can find answers to common questions within 3 clicks or searches from the landing page
- **SC-003**: 100% of spec-kitty slash commands are documented in the Reference section
- **SC-004**: Each major feature has content in at least 2 of the 4 Divio types (typically Reference + either Tutorial or How-To)
- **SC-005**: Zero outdated or inaccurate information remains after audit (verified by comparison with current codebase)
- **SC-006**: All tutorials are end-to-end testable (a user can follow them and achieve the stated outcome)

## Assumptions

- The documentation will be written in Markdown and stored in the repository
- The primary documentation location is the `docs/` directory
- Existing valuable content (if any) will be identified during the audit phase
- The documentation does not need to cover spec-kitty internals or contributor guides (out of scope)
- Version-specific documentation is not required; docs will target the current stable version
